Here we'll cover Hibernate one-to one bi-directional.

So, we currently have a uni-directional mapping now we wanna load an InstructorDetail object and then 
we'd like to get the associated Instructor for that detail object. thus the relation will be like;
 
 Instructor <---> InstructorDetails
 
 Based on that mapping we are going to perform Create and Delete operations on Database.
 
 for DB schema import we have attached SQL file in following folder to import in MYSQL:
 
 -->	/hibernate-adv-db-mapping/starter_db_files/hibernate-mapping-database-scripts/hb-01-one-to-one-uni
